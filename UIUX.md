### Responsive Design: 

All elements scale proportionally to screen size, ensuring usability on both mobile and desktop devices without sacrificing readability or functionality.

The sidebar automatically switches between vertical and horizontal layouts based on screen width.

Key content, such as slides, remains centered and adjusts in size without distortion.

### Navigation and Information Hierarchy: 

Core controls like "New Slide" and "Delete Slide" are placed at the top of the editor for immediate access.

Navigation elements are organized logically, so users can quickly find actions like slide navigation or element addition in the sidebar.

### Visibility: 

Buttons use distinct colors and sizes to make clickable areas easy to identify.

Each button has a descriptive label.

Important actions are emphasized with vibrant colors, making essential functions like "Save" and "Delete" immediately recognizable.

### Affordance: 

Buttons provide visual feedback, such as color changes on hover.

The cursor changes to a pointer on interactive elements, reinforcing which areas are clickable.

### Feedback: 

Users see immediate changes when they add, edit, or delete elements, providing a responsive and interactive experience.

Pop-ups open when users interact with elements, allowing focused editing without losing the context of the main content.

When input is incorrect or missing, users receive clear error messages.

### Consistency: 

Fonts, colors, and button shapes are consistent throughout the website.

Icons and button designs remain the same on all pages.

Common styles are applied through CSS/MUI, ensuring consistent design elements for fonts, colors, and layout across components.

### Constraints: 

Fields like video URLs enforce specific formats, reducing errors and preventing invalid data from being submitted.

Users are notified if inputs donâ€™t meet required criteria, such as missing fields or incorrect URL formats.

### Effectiveness & Utility:

Essential actions like adding text, images, videos, or code are easily accessible from the sidebar.

Users can complete most tasks without needing to navigate away from the main editor.

### Efficiency: 

Data is saved locally so users can leave and return to their work without losing progress.

Code optimizations and efficient data handling ensure fast load times.

### Load Performance and Image Optimization: 

Images are optimized to reduce file size.

Images and videos are loaded only when needed, conserving resources and speeding up initial load times.
